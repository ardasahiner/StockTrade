@Jaemin : Look into working on login and signup pages, there are some cool packages that make nicer html forms, maybe we could do that? 

Need to finish home page, login and signup page.
 - Gather content for home page and put it all in
 - Create a footer to be present on all pages, make as partial
 - Signup form needs to contain all relevant parts (password confirmation, etc)

Make all authenticated pages:
 - Individual stock page templates
 - My Profile page to edit profile attributes
