// In this doc, discuss what the api should look like.

Users API:
  /user/ POST requests allow you to create a new user
  /user/ GET requests allow you to pull database of all users

  /user/:user_id GET requests allow you to pull database of specific user
  /user/:user_id PUT requests allow you to update data of specific user
  /user/:user_id DELETE requests delete a specific user

  Need to implement:
    - User Authentication
    - User Class need a lot of work (needs users stock holdings, balance, etc)
    - We need to log user data so that admin can see how often the log in, how much time they spend on the website, etc (useful stats for product management)

Stocks API:
  Still need to implement (Kunal is working on this right now)
  /stock/:stock_ticker GET requests will allow you to get the stock price of a specific stock
  Need to look into acquiring historic stock data

Admin API:
  This will be where we can access administrative data
    - Users
    - Page Hits
    - etc
  We need to implement data logging so that we can track all of these things
