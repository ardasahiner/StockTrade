// In this doc, discuss what the api should look like.

  Need to implement:
    - User Class need a lot of work (needs users stock holdings, balance, etc)
      -What should the user class have?
        -user_id
        -some data structure to store what stocks they own and the number of each stock
        -remaining liquid balance
        -some data structure to store dates and details of transactions
    - We need to log user data so that admin can see how often the log in, how much time they spend on the website, etc (useful stats for product management)

Stocks API:
  Still need to implement
  /stock/:stock_ticker GET requests will allow you to get the stock price of a specific stock
  Need to look into acquiring historic stock data

  Maybe could do:
  /stock/:stock_ticker/:mmddyyyy GET requests to get the stock price of a specific stock at a specific time, but need to see if Yahoo has stuff on this

  Ideally there would also be something here that would allow you to display how a stock price has changed over time
  (This could be just using the GET request above a bunch of times and then letting front end handle the rest)

  Add a Group model (either public or private that has a group of users and a way to sort them by earnings)
