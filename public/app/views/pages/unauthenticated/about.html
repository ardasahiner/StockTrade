                    <h3>Our Product</h3>
                    <p class="aboutPageText whatWeDoText">vStock is a real-time virtual stock trading platform where users can trade stocks and watch them grow. Each user starts with $100,000 in virtual cash and can spend it on any US equities traded on the BATS stock exchange. Users can also create "bot accounts," writing scripts to access our RESTful API to track the prices of stocks and make transactions. Traders have the opportunity gain experience and develop strategies before heading out into the real market. </p>

                    <h3>Our Tech</h3>
                    <p class="aboutPageText whatWeDoText">Launched in August 2016, vStock is built on the MEAN stack, a fast and scalable web platform. vStock aims not only to be a site where users can challenge both their friends and themselves to a game of luck and wit, but also to be a tool to analyze the financial market itself. Once fully implemented, our machine learning engine will identify predictive factors for a stock's rise or fall and share its predictions with our traders. We hope to give our users a platform for both fun and future success.</p>
